    "**Note:** In previous assignments, we have called this a **train-test split**. However, the portion of data that we don't train on will be used to help **select model parameters**. Thus, this portion of data should be called a **validation set**. Recall that examining performance of various potential models (i.e. models with different parameters) should be on a validation set, while evaluation of selected model should always be on a test set. Typically, we would also save a portion of the data (a real test set) to test our final model on or use cross-validation on the training set to select our final model. But for the learning purposes of this assignment, we won't do that.  "
